    Part of an <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/sofai/home' target="_blank">IBM Watson Research Lab Group</a>, led by Dr. Rossi, comprised of researchers from IBM
    and various universities.
    With this research group, we are analyzing well-known cognitive theories to define a general AI paradigm
    starting from cognitive theories such as the one popularized by D. Kahneman in his book <a target="_blank" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow'><i>Thinking Fast and Slow</i></a>.
