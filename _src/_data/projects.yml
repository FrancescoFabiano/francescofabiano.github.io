    The SOFAI project project whose aim is to advance AI by leveraging cognitive theories of how humans make decisions,
    with particular focus on the <a target="_blank" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow'>Thinking Fast and Slow</a> theory of Daniel Kahneman.
    The project is led by IBM Research in collaboration with several academic partners.

  long_title: Epistemic Forward Planner
  date: ongoing
  github: https://github.com/FrancescoFabiano/EFP
  description: |
    This project implemets a solver, called EFP, designed following the imperative programming paradigm.
    In particular, the solver is fully developed in C++.
    EFP is a general and comprehensive epistemic forward solver that can solve problems defined in mA*.
    Moreover, thanks to the introduction of agents’ attitudes and other capabilities, the planner
    allows the users to tailor actions in whichever fashion they prefer without having
    to worry about tedious and intricate effects definitions.

    The 19th Doctoral Consortium (DC) on Logic Programming was part of the <a href='https://iclp2023.imperial.ac.uk/home' target="_blank">39th International Conference on Logic Programming</a> (ICLP 2023).
    The DC provided students and early career researchers with the opportunity
    to present and discuss their research directions, obtain feedback from both peers and experts in the field, and participate
    in mentoring sessions on how to prepare for a research career.
    In particular, the DC hosted leaders in logic programming research, from academia and industry, that
    gave talks on their research areas and comment on the presented works, providing valuable insights for early career researchers.
